                <h2>Breast Cancer Detection</h2>
                <p>
                    Implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN), a support vector machine (SVM), and a vision transformer
                    (ViT) model to detect breast cancer in mammogram x-ray images.
                    Applied data pre-processing techniques to improve model accuracy, achieving an average accuracy of at least 70%
                    and peak accuracies exceeding 80%.

                <p>
                    Developed an interactive, embedded laser pointer toy for cats using Arduino and Raspberry Pi, featuring
                    YOLOv8-based Python object detection to autonomously track and engage with pets.
                    Designed and 3D-printed a custom enclosure with both automated and manual control modes, allowing
                    user-operated precision via joystick, enhancing product usability and functionality.

                <p>
                    Streamlined live data including equipment metrics, social media engagement, queue tracking, entry/exit, and more
                    to display on custom analytics dashboard.
                    Developed using JavaScript, Python, React, and Git, with project management through Asana.

                    Created at HackGT23, this project is a Java based game where players
                    can expereince the life of cats. Featuring an engaging story along with 
                    challenging mini games. The project was created in less than 36 hours,
                    which required me to learn new skills in a limited time period. The Java LibGDX
                    library was used to create the game.

                <h2>Dungeon Crawler Mobile Game</h2>
                <p>
                    Operated within an Agile-based scrum development framework to develop a 2D dungeon crawler style mobile game
                    implementing a user-friendly interface and utilizing object-oriented programming principles to create modular and
                    maintainable codebase.
                    Programmed in Java using Android Studio, managed project workflow with Trello and Git version control.

                <p>
                    Leveraged MQTT (via RabbitMQ) to upload location and metadata post-classification to Adafruit IO, populating
                    the frontend dashboard created using Python-based web framework.
                    Implemented using Python, Bootstrap, Dash, Edge Impulse, and an Openmv H7 Camera.

                <p>
                    This website is another project of mine. My intention in creating it is to not only
                    have a place where anyone can get all the important information 
                    about me, but also it is something I decided to do to brush up on my 
                    dusty HTML/CSS web development skills.
