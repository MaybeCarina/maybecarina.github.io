                    Implemented autonomous exploration capabilities for off-the-shelf quadruped robots using ROS.
                    Developed SLAM-based navigation systems to create accurate real-time maps of environments, enabling effective
                    obstacle avoidance and safe autonomous operation.
                    Employed computer vision techniques for human detection and tracking.
                    Communicated spatial information and video stream using MQTT and TCP/IP protocols to Unity for 3D map
                    visualization and VR user experience.
                    Created a VR application in Unity for immersive remote control of the robot
