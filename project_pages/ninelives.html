                Created at HackGT23, this project is a Java based game where players
                can expereince the life of cats. Featuring an engaging story along with 
                challenging mini games. The project was created in less than 36 hours,
                which required me to learn new skills in a limited time period. The Java LibGDX
                library was used to create the game.
