                The primary aim of the dashboard is to provide a dynamic, interactive, and user-friendly platform for real-time data visualization and management. The goals include developing a responsive interface using modern technologies like React and Next.js, integrating real-time data through APIs, enabling customizability with dynamic widget views, and ensuring the dashboard's scalability and performance

                The project development began by establishing foundational UI components, including an interactive button that used APIs to fetch and display data using React and Next.js. This set the stage for more complex features. The team then transitioned from Flowbite to DaisyUI, enhancing the dashboard's aesthetics and functionality and refining support for a variety of UI widgets. The frontend team prioritized enhancing the adaptability of the widget grid to dynamically respond to changes in screen size, thereby improving the overall responsiveness of the dashboard. In collaboration with the backend team, a significant effort was made to integrate live data feeds, particularly focusing on the SUMs API. This integration enables the real-time display of critical metrics such as user counts and tool statuses, essential for operational efficiency.

                The development of a dynamic widget view was initiated to allow users to customize their information display, catering to personal preferences and enhancing interaction with the dashboard. To support this functionality across the platform, Redux was implemented for global state management, ensuring a cohesive and stable user experience.

                This project was created using ReactJS, ApexCharts (poltting library), Redux (state management tool), and NextJS in combination with the backend which used AWS (Lambdas, DynamoDB, etc.), flask, and python.
