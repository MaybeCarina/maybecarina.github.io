            <h1>Motor Controller Peripheral</h1>
            <p>
                Created an SCOMP peripheral that has the ability to control at least four
                servo motors at once. Could handle pulse width ranges from 0.6 to 2.4ms. 
                While an SCOMP programmer can send a 16 bit value as input to our peripheral, we decided to configure only bits 11-0 for simplicity, as the operand is 
                11 bits. Thus, we designated four different addresses for each servo motor. Peripheral
                allowed users to customize desired pulse width range and velocity settings.
                Our plan was to make a flexible servo motor control peripheral that can support a variety of user projects.
