                <h1>Hello! </h1>
                <p>I'm Carina Copeland, a recent graduate of Georgia Tech
                    with a degree in Computer Science. I’m passionate about 
                    solving real-world problems through technology, focusing on areas like 
                    robotics, machine learning, and full-stack development. With 
                    experience in Python, ROS, TensorFlow, React, and more, I’ve worked 
                    on diverse projects ranging from autonomous robots to Android apps and 
                    web dashboards. </p>
                <p>
                    Here, you'll find a collection of my work, as well as more
                    information about my background. Feel free to explore my portfolio, 
                    and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to connect!
