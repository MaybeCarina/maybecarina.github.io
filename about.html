            <h1>Hi! I'm Carina!</h1>
            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
            I just finished my BS in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of technology. During my degree, my concentration was in Devices and Intelligence
            which emcompases devices embedded in physical objects that interact with the physical world and how
            they interact and use intellident models.
            </p>
            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>
            Inline with my degree and concentration, I will always have a strong interest in robotics, machine learning applications, and creating computational 
            artifacts that interact with the real world. SOme of my favorite opportunities allowed me to work hands on creating devices or working with robots. 
            </p>
